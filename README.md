# StructEnrollProgram
# This is a C language Struct program that lets the user register students for a CSIT class.

When the user opens the program, they are asked to enter the number of courses they wish to register the students for.

Afterwards, they enter the course the name of the course. NOTE, when entering the name of the CSIT course, the course name must be together, not seprate. For example, 'CSIT430'or 'CSIT321. Not 'CSIT 323' or 'CSIT 123' for example. Otherwise, the program will not function.

Since the MAX is set at 6, the user has the maxiumum of 6 students to add for each course. 

After the user enters the name and GPA of the student, a message will appear to determine if they are registered for the course.

NOTE : The major required to take the courses is 'Computer Science'. For a student to take a CSIT course, their major must be Computer Science. Otherwise, they will be turned down to take a CSIT course

Once the max number of students are entered, the registraiton for the next course will appear and the process starts over until it hits the number of courses that was set to be registered from the start.
